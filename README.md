## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design and develop applications.

The key principles of OOP are **(A-Pie)**:
  1. **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
  2. **Polymorphism**: Allows entities (like variables, functions, or objects) to have multiple forms, enabling them to behave differently based on the context or the type of object involved. 
  3. **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class (derived/child class) inherits properties(variables) and behavior (methods/functions) from an existing class (base/parent class).
  4. **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.
