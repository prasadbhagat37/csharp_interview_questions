# C# Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design and develop applications.

The key principles of OOP are **(A-Pie)**:
  1. **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
  2. **Polymorphism**: Allows entities (like variables, functions, or objects) to have multiple forms, enabling them to behave differently based on the context or the type of object involved. 
  3. **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class (derived/child class) inherits properties(variables) and behavior (methods/functions) from an existing class (base/parent class).
  4. **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.

## 2. Advantages of OOP's

**Modularity**: OOP promotes a modular approach to programming, breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable objects, making code easier to understand, maintain, and modify. 
**Code Reusability**: OOP allows developers to create reusable components (classes and objects) that can be used in different parts of the code or even across different projects, saving time and effort. 
**Encapsulation**:OOP's encapsulation feature hides internal implementation details and offers clearly defined interfaces for dealing with objects, further improving manageability and security. 
**Inheritance**:Inheritance allows developers to create new classes (subclasses) based on existing ones (superclasses), inheriting their properties and behaviors, promoting code reuse and a hierarchical structure. 
**Code Maintenance**:OOP's modular and organized structure simplifies code maintenance and upgrades, as individual modules can be modified without affecting the entire system. 
**Better Problem-Solving**:OOP encourages developers to think in terms of real-world objects and relationships, leading to more intuitive and organized code design, which aids in better problem-solving. 
**Improved Software Development Productivity**:By promoting code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance, OOP significantly increases software development productivity. 
**Scalability**:OOP supports scalability by allowing developers to add new objects and classes as the system grows, making it easier to accommodate changes and enhancements in the software. 
**Security**:OOP's encapsulation and access control mechanisms enhance security by hiding internal implementation details and preventing unauthorized access to data. 
**Extensibility**:OOP makes code more extensible, allowing developers to add new features and functionalities to the application without compromising or altering the existing code. 
**Faster Development**:OOP's features, such as code reusability and modularity, enable faster development cycles and reduced development costs. 

## 2. What is Class?
A class is blueprint or template.

## 3. What is Object?
An object is instance of class.
